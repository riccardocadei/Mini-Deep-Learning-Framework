# EE-559 Project1

## General Information

The repository contains the code for Project 2 of the Deep Learning (EE-559) course at EPFL during Spring term 2021. 

### Team
The project is accomplished by:
- Riccardo Cadei: [@riccardocadei](https://github.com/riccardocadei)
- Riccardo Fradiani: [@riccardofradiani](https://github.com/riccardofradiani)
- Niccol√≤ Polvani: [@nickpolvani](https://github.com/nickpolvani)

### Abstract
The aim of this project is to design and implement a mini deep learning framework based only on \texttt{PyTorch}'s tensor definition and elementary mathematical operations (without preexisting deep learning toolbox). Several modules are proposed (Fully Connected Linear Layer and Activation Functions) to create different Neural Networks (mainly Multi Layer Perceptron), define a Loss Function, compute the gradient with respect to it (using BackPropagation algorithm) and train the model using Batch Gradient Descent optimizer. Different experimental tests are conducted using exclusively this framework for a binary classification problem (Test Error=2.29%).

For further information about this project, read `report.pdf`.

### Environment
The project has been developed and test with `python3.8.3`.

Required libraries: `Pytorch`.

To plot: `matplotlib`, `mlxtend`.
